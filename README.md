## ⚡ Key Features

### 🏗️ Hackintosh Builder (Hardware Recommender)
*   **Budget-Dynamic Tiers**: Intelligent hardware selection ranging from ₹30,000 (Entry Level) to ₹6,00,000 (God Tier).
*   **Component Matching**: Balanced builds pairing Intel Core (10th-14th Gen) with natively supported AMD Radeon GPUs (RX 580 to RX 7900 XTX).
*   **Direct Purchase Links**: One-click "Buy" buttons that launch targeted Amazon search queries for every recommended component.
*   **Instant EFI Matching**: Generate a tuned OpenCore EFI folder specifically optimized for your selected hardware tier directly from the builder.

### 💎 Premium ToolBox (v1.1 Special)
*   **SMBIOS Manager**: Generate high-quality Serial Numbers, Board Serials, and UUIDs for any Mac model with one-click copying.
*   **SIP & Gatekeeper Manager**: Real-time status reporting and guidance on security configurations.
*   **GUI Boot-Arg Dashboard**: Effortlessly toggle common boot-args (`-v`, `debug`, `pikera`) without touching a Plist editor.
*   **Kext Update Checker**: Instantly check GitHub for the latest core kernel extensions (Lilu, WEG, AppleALC, VirtualSMC).
*   **EFI Vault**: Create compressed, timestamped backups of your working EFI directly to your Documents folder.

### 🛠️ Pre-Install: EFI Builder & Setup
*   **Smart EFI Builder**: Dynamically generates solid OpenCore EFI folders based on your hardware selections and CPU generation (Intel 10th to 14th Gen).
*   **Solid Configurations**: Tailored SSDTs (e.g., `SSDT-PLUG-ALT` for 12th+ Gen) and pre-configured drivers for a "perfect first boot."
*   **macOS Installer Creator**: Directly fetches official macOS versions from Apple's servers and creates bootable USB media with real-time logs.

### 🔧 Post-Install: Smart Hardware Repair & Stability
*   **Robust EFI Mounting**: Improved auto-detection with admin privilege prompts and a manual partition picker for complex multi-disk setups.
*   **Freeze Analysis (Async)**: Background scanning of system logs to diagnose recent Kernel Panics and driver conflicts without freezing the app.
*   **Laptop Specific Support**: Intelligent detection of Laptop hardware with one-click injection for Battery and Trackpad fixes.
*   **SSD Health & TRIM**: Real-time S.M.A.R.T. status verification and one-click TRIM toggle for APFS stability.
*   **Safety Compatibility Guard**: Advanced logic that matches drivers to specific Vendor IDs (Intel, Broadcom, Realtek). Incompatible injections are blocked to prevent system crashes.

#### 🎨 Native Experience
